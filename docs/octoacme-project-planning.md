# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Manager and Business Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) with input from QA Lead
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map (coordinated with Release Manager)
7. Establish agile ceremonies and team rhythm (facilitated by Scrum Master)
8. Define UX/design deliverables and review cycles (if UX/UI Designer is involved)
