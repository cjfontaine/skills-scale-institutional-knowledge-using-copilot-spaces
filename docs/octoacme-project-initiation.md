# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Project One-pager Template
- **Project name**:
- **Problem statement**:
- **Objective / Goal (SMART)**:
- **Success metrics**:
- **Primary stakeholders**:
- **Suggested timeline / milestones**:
- **Quick risks & dependencies**:
- **Proposed team / roles**:
  - Project Manager:
  - Product Manager:
  - Developers:
  - QA Lead:
  - Release Manager (if deployment complexity warrants):
  - Business Analyst (if significant requirements discovery needed):
  - Scrum Master (for agile delivery):
  - UX/UI Designer (if user experience is a primary focus):
  - Other specialists as needed:

## Initiation Checklist
- [ ] One-pager completed and reviewed by Product Lead
- [ ] Sponsor / Stakeholder alignment (email or meeting)
- [ ] Decision: Approve to move into planning?
- [ ] Create repo or project board skeleton
- [ ] Add initial artifacts to repo (docs/ or .copilot/)

## Decision Gate
Move to planning when:
- Success metrics are clear
- Stakeholders agree on priority
- Team availability is confirmed

## Escalation Path
During initiation, if decisions or approvals are blocked:
- **Level 1**: Project Manager works with Product Manager to resolve
- **Level 2**: Escalate to Sponsor or executive stakeholder
- **Level 3**: Steering committee or leadership team for strategic decisions

For role-specific escalations, see [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md).
